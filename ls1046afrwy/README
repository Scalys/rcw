The RCW directories names for the LS1046AFRWY boards conform to the following
naming convention:

ab_cdefghij_k_l:

a = 'R' indicates RGMII1@DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R' indicates RGMII2@DTSEC4 is supported
    'N' indicates not available/not used

c = What is available in SerDes1 Lane0
d = What is available in SerDes1 Lane1
e = What is available in SerDes1 Lane2
f = What is available in SerDes1 Lane3
g = What is available in SerDes2 Lane0
h = What is available in SerDes2 Lane1
i = What is available in SerDes2 Lane2
j = What is available in SerDes2 Lane3

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'X' is XAUI
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA
 'A' is AURORA

Serdes1 protocol (k):
k = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (l):
l = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/FMan/DDR
Bin1: 1600MHz/600MHz/700MHz/1800MT/s
Bin2: 1200MHz/400MHz/500MHz/1800MT/s

Serdes protocol:
================
NN_NNQNNPNP_3040_0506 means:
 - Not used on  board
 - Not used on board
 - Not used on board
 - Not used on board
 - QSGMII6@DTSEC6 on board
 - Not used on board
 - Not used on board
 - PCIe1 on Slot 1, mPCIe
 - Not used on board
 - PCIe2 on Slot 2, mPCIe
 - SERDES1 Protocol is 0x3040
 - SERDES2 Protocol is 0x0506

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_specialsetting.rcw
x = Core frequency
bootmode = bootmode:qspiboot and so on.
specialsetting = special setting:
			sben:Secure boot
For example,
	rcw_1600_qspiboot.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1600MHz with QSPI boot.
